1.Get me the IP address of a particular domain (guvi.in) :  nslookup guvi.in

 How do I find my CPU/memory usage of my server: top

 Test the connectivity between 2 nodes: ping 172.67.70.207

2. I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs show my app is running, but I’m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?

   command: telnet guvi.com 9000
